lo.fish is a new programming language created by <a href="https://default.fm">W.</a>, currently still work in progress. lo.fish is designed to capture the essence of the Yoneda Lemma in Category Theory, which can be understood as follow: "Everything we need to know about an object in a category is completely determined by its arrows to every object in that category."

<br/><br/>
  
In a way, <b>the Yoneda Lemma is the category-theoretic correspondence of anattā in Buddhism</b>.

<br/><br/>
According to Shakyamuni's Dharma, anattā (Pali: 𑀅𑀦𑀢𑁆𑀢𑀸; directly translated as *none-self* or 無我) is one of the three marks of existence. Anattā is synonymous with Anātman (an + ātman) in Sanskrit. Anattā can be understood as a strategy to attain non-attachment to Samsara by recognizing that no phenomenon (inside Samsara) can have a permanent, unchanging "self" or essence.

<br/><br/>

  Understanding and realizing the true nature of anattā in daily meditation and mindfulness practices is at the core of cultivating samatha-vipassanā i.e. "to gain tranquillity-insight into the true nature of reality".

According to <a href="https://default.fm/theory-of-consciousness">W.'s Theory of Consciousness</a>, the cultivation of samatha-vipassanā is the physiologically equivalence of an individual developing the conscious ability to release and inhibit any neurotransmitters at will at any moment in time, and at a more advanced level to perform protein folding, etc, at well as to 
  do intesresting things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_nutricula">Turritopsis_nutricula</a> as long as it doesn't violate the law of physics.
